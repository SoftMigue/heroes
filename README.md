# Spring-boot-h2 Swagger
In this example I have used H2 as in memory database and rest web services are exposed via Swagger-UI.
Project can be executed as follows: 

 - mvn clean install
 - mvn spring-boot:run

After the project is up and running DB, Services and Swagger-UI can be accessed as follows:
 - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
